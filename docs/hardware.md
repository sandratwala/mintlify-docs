title: "Hardware & State of Health"
---


Probe uses a physical battery-testing system to collect electrical and environmental measurements from used Lithium-Ion batteries.

Battery condition is determined from real sensor measurements and a **hardcoded State of Health (SoH) calculation**, rather than a trained AI or machine-learning model.

##  Hardware

### Battery Sensors

Sensors are connected to the Lithium-Ion battery during testing and capture measurements in real time.

The system measures:

* **Temperature**
* **Voltage**
* **Current**

These measurements provide the raw data used to evaluate the battery's condition.

### ESP32

The **ESP32** acts as the microcontroller for the testing hardware.

It:

1. Reads measurements from the connected sensors.
2. Packages the sensor readings.
3. Publishes the raw telemetry to the **🐝HiveMQ MQTT broker**.

##  Data Pipeline

The hardware data pipeline connects the physical battery to the Probe backend and recycler dashboard.

### Pipeline Flow

**1. Sensor Measurement**

The battery sensors capture temperature, voltage, and current while the battery is being tested.

**2. Telemetry Transmission**

The ESP32 receives the measurements and publishes the raw readings to HiveMQ using MQTT.

**3. State of Health Calculation**

The SoH Module subscribes to the raw telemetry from HiveMQ and processes the measurements using a **hardcoded formula**.

The calculation produces tested battery information, including the battery's State of Health and classification.

**4. Data Distribution**

The resulting tested battery data is:

* Published for the recycler dashboard.
* Sent to the FastAPI backend.
* Verified and stored in PostgreSQL.

##  State of Health (SoH)

Probe does not use an AI model to determine battery condition.

Instead, the system uses a predefined **hardcoded formula** based on the measurements collected from the physical testing hardware.

Current
       ↓
Hardcoded SoH Formula

```

The calculated result is then associated with the tested battery and made available to the rest of the Probe platform.

##  Hardware-to-Platform Flow

The complete hardware-to-platform flow can be summarized as:

This architecture allows Probe to connect **physical battery testing with digital inventory and reuse workflows**, giving recyclers access to battery condition data and enabling suitable batteries to move toward reuse.
