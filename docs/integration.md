Probe integrates several services to connect the hardware testing system, backend API, database, and web dashboard.

The main integrations are **Heroku, Vercel, PostgreSQL, and HiveMQ**. Together, these services support application hosting, data storage, API communication, and real-time sensor data transmission.

The integration flow allows Probe to move data from the physical testing hardware through the MQTT broker and backend before it is stored and presented to users.

##  External Services

| Service        | Purpose                                                         | Integration                                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Heroku**     | Hosts the FastAPI backend and PostgreSQL database               | Backend deployment and production configuration                                |
| **Vercel**     | Hosts the Next.js web dashboard                                 | Communicates with the FastAPI API through `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`                |
| **PostgreSQL** | Stores users, devices, batteries, bookings, and sensor readings | Connected to FastAPI through SQLAlchemy                                        |
| **HiveMQ**     | MQTT broker for hardware communication                          | Receives sensor data from ESP32 and distributes messages to subscribed clients |

---

##  Heroku Integration

Heroku hosts the Probe backend application and its PostgreSQL database.

The backend uses environment variables for production configuration, including:

```text
DATABASE_URL
JWT_SECRET_KEY
JWT_ALGORITHM
JWT_EXPIRE_DAYS
CORS_ORIGINS
```

The backend can be deployed through Git or a connected GitHub repository.

The deployment process follows:

```text
Code Changes
     ↓
Git Push
     ↓
Heroku Build
     ↓
Dependencies Installed
     ↓
FastAPI Application Started
     ↓
Production API Available
```

Heroku also provides the production environment in which the FastAPI application communicates with the PostgreSQL database.

---

##  Vercel Integration

Vercel hosts the Probe web dashboard built with **Next.js**.

The frontend requires the backend API URL through:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
```

For local development:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

For production, the variable points to the deployed FastAPI backend.

The communication flow is:

```text
UPS Company / Recycler
          ↓
     Next.js Dashboard
          ↓
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
          ↓
      FastAPI API
          ↓
       PostgreSQL
```

When the production API URL is changed, the Vercel deployment must be redeployed so that the updated environment configuration is applied.

---

##  PostgreSQL Integration

PostgreSQL is Probe's primary relational database.

The FastAPI backend connects to PostgreSQL using the `DATABASE_URL` configuration value.

SQLAlchemy is used as the ORM layer, while **Alembic** manages database schema migrations.

The main application data stored in PostgreSQL includes:

* Users
* Devices
* Batteries
* Sensor readings
* Bookings

The database integration follows:

```text
FastAPI
   ↓
SQLAlchemy
   ↓
PostgreSQL
   ↓
Probe Application Data
```

Database schema changes are applied through Alembic migrations:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

---

##  HiveMQ / MQTT Integration

HiveMQ provides the MQTT communication layer between the physical testing hardware and the software system.

The **ESP32** publishes sensor measurements through MQTT. These measurements include:

* Temperature
* Voltage
* Current

The MQTT broker receives the messages and makes them available to subscribed clients.

```text
ESP32
  │
  │ MQTT Publish
  ▼
HiveMQ Broker
  │
  │ MQTT Subscribe
  ▼
SOH / Backend Processing
  │
  ├──► Battery Health Results
  │
  └──► Sensor Data Storage
```

The MQTT communication layer allows sensor data to be transmitted without requiring the ESP32 to communicate directly with the web dashboard.

##  Integration Data Flow

A typical battery testing workflow moves through the following services:

```text
1. Battery connected to testing hardware
              ↓
2. ESP32 reads sensors
              ↓
3. ESP32 publishes readings through MQTT
              ↓
4. HiveMQ receives the sensor message
              ↓
5. SOH processing calculates battery health
              ↓
6. Tested battery data is sent to the backend
              ↓
7. FastAPI validates and processes the data
              ↓
8. PostgreSQL stores the results
              ↓
9. Next.js dashboard requests the data
              ↓
10. Recycler views battery testing results
```

For the UPS company workflow:

```text
UPS Company
     ↓
Vercel-hosted Dashboard
     ↓
GET /batteries/
     ↓
FastAPI Backend
     ↓
PostgreSQL
     ↓
Available Battery Inventory
     ↓
UPS Company Selects Battery
     ↓
POST /bookings/
     ↓
FastAPI Backend
     ↓
Booking Created
     ↓
Status: PENDING
```

##  Integration Configuration Summary

| Integration          | Configuration                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heroku → FastAPI     | Production environment variables and deployment configuration |
| FastAPI → PostgreSQL | `DATABASE_URL`                                                |
| Vercel → FastAPI     | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`                                         |
| ESP32 → HiveMQ       | MQTT broker connection and topic configuration                |
| FastAPI → HiveMQ     | MQTT client configuration and subscriptions                   |
| FastAPI → PostgreSQL | SQLAlchemy connection and Alembic migrations                  |

These integrations allow Probe to operate as a connected system rather than as separate hardware, backend, database, and frontend components.
