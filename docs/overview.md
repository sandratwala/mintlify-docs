## Automated Battery Testing & Reuse Platform
<p className="probe-lead">
Probe is a cloud-connected battery testing and inventory platform designed to help recyclers assess used lithium-ion batteries and connect batteries suitable for reuse with UPS companies.
</p>


By combining **IoT-enabled battery testing, a backend API, inventory management, and booking workflows**, Probe creates a bridge between battery recyclers and organizations looking for reliable second-life battery sources.

## What is Probe?

Probe provides a structured workflow for taking a used battery from **physical testing to potential reuse**.

A recycler places a battery into the Probe testing hardware. The connected sensors capture electrical and environmental measurements, including:

<div className="probe-tags">
  <span className="probe-tag">Temperature</span>
  <span className="probe-tag">Resting voltage</span>
  <span className="probe-tag">Load voltage</span>
  <span className="probe-tag">Current</span>
</div>

The IoT device transmits these measurements to the backend using **MQTT**. The backend validates and processes the incoming telemetry, calculates the battery's **State of Health (SoH)**, and stores the resulting information for use across the platform.

The tested battery can then be managed as part of the recycler's inventory. UPS companies can browse suitable batteries and submit booking requests through the platform.


## The Problem It Solves
Battery recycling and redistribution often depend on manual testing, inventory tracking, and communication between recyclers and organizations looking for battery stock.


Probe brings these processes into one connected platform, making it easier to test, manage, and reuse suitable batteries.


It enables:


Recyclers to register, test, and manage battery inventory.
UPS companies to discover available batteries and submit booking requests.
Users to track bookings through a defined status lifecycle.
Connected hardware to transmit battery readings to the platform for processing and monitoring.


This creates a clearer workflow from battery testing → assessment → inventory → reuse.
